"""The fixture seam: snapshot, restore, inspect, drain -- and one composition of stores.

The recorder needs four verbs from whatever holds the system's state, and it
needs them before EVERY vector: restore to the snapshot, inspect, run the
steps, drain the queues, inspect again. ``Fixture`` is that contract as a
Protocol so a consumer can supply its own (a product may inspect through its
own application code, which sees typed rows the plain-text readers do not).
``ComposedFixture`` is the stdlib one: a set of store adapters and an injected
drain callable.

The inspection shape is fixed so the diff can be generic:

    {"rows": {table: [row, ...]},           relational tables
     "collections": {name: [doc, ...]},     document collections
     "queues": {name: depth},               work still pending
     "redis_keys": [key, ...],              cache/key-value keys present
     "objects": {store: {key: etag}}}       object-store listings

Every key is always present, empty when no store reports it. Two stores
reporting the SAME table/collection/queue name is ``FixtureError``: a silent
overwrite would hide one store's delta behind the other's.

Two observation modes. ``inspect`` before and after every vector costs the
size of the database each time -- a minute on a snapshot with a few hundred
thousand rows even when one row changed. A store that can OBSERVE its own
changes (a relational server's binary log, a document store's oplog) offers
``mark()`` and ``changes_since(mark)`` instead, and the fixture exposes them
as ``ObservingFixture``: the recorder marks, runs the steps, drains, and reads
exactly what changed. Cost follows what changed, not what exists. The delta it
returns is the same shape ``diff.store_delta`` produces, so the comparison is
unchanged; only how it was obtained differs, and the vector's provenance
records which.

An observing fixture also knows whether a vector wrote anything. A read
vector that changed nothing needs no restore before the next one; the
recorder asks ``dirty`` and skips the restore, which is most vectors.

Draining is bounded and honest. The fixture calls the injected drain callable,
re-inspects, and stops when every queue reports empty; after ``max_drain_rounds``
it raises ``QueuesNotDrained`` naming the queues still holding work. A queue
that never empties is a finding about the system, not something to wait out
forever or to report as drained. With no drain callable and work pending, it
raises at once: nothing can drain it.
