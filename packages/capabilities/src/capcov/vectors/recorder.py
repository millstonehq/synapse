"""Record boundary vectors against the incumbent: the loop, the layout, the seams.

``record`` is the whole recording design in one loop. For every operation the
consumer's loader hands over, the fixed template yields cells; for every cell
the driver builds requests; then, per vector: restore the fixture to the
snapshot, inspect, send every request through the oracle, drain after each
step unless the cell says not to, inspect again, and diff the two inspections
into the declared delta and the informational remainder. What could not be
driven is a gap beside the vectors, never a shorter list.

The three seams are objects the consumer supplies, by plugin string from the
CLI or directly from Python:

* **fixture**  -- ``vectors.fixture.Fixture``: ``snapshot`` / ``restore`` /
  ``inspect`` / ``drain``.
* **oracle**   -- the incumbent. ``base_url`` (``None`` when it serves no HTTP,
  so every HTTP vector is a gap rather than a connection error), ``send(Request)
  -> (status, body)``, ``run_shell(Request) -> (status, body)``. Optionally
  ``credential(actor) -> dict | None`` (``{"bearer"}``, ``{"cookie"}``,
  ``{"headers"}``, ``{"secret"}``); when the oracle has no such method the
  manifest's ``credentials`` table, keyed by ``str(actor)``, is read instead.
  An actor with neither is a driver gap. Optionally ``drain()``, used in place
  of the fixture's when the incumbent's queues are worked by its own tooling.
* **candidate** -- the rebuild, same surface, in ``replay``.

Layout: ``<out_dir>/<operation>/vectors.json`` (``replay.json`` beside it), one
directory per operation, the directory named by the operation id percent-
encoded so any id round-trips (``op_dir`` / ``op_id_of``). Both files are
capcov artifacts: ``kind`` and ``derived_from`` on top, the versioned vectors
or replay document beneath, so ``artifacts.read`` refuses the wrong kind.

Refusals. An oracle whose ``send`` returns something other than a two-tuple is
a wiring error naming the seam. An id the layout cannot hold (empty, ``.`` or
``..``) is refused. Nothing here catches an exception from the fixture: a
restore that fails is not a vector that passed.
